# Rank 'Em All

Rank 'Em All is a ranking game that allows a large group of people to create community rankings for Pokemon.

An ELO system is used to create matchups and update ratings.

If you want to run this locally, you'll need to create your own postgresql database from the pokemon.sql dump and update the dummy auth information in queries.js

test!!!
